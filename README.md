# ML1
This repository contains 5 Machine Learning Models based on Classification,Regression and Clustering Problems
1.Classification Models are loan3.ipynb and adult_census.ipynb
2.Regression Models are Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb and sales.ipynb
3.Clustering Model is cluster.ipynb
In the Regression problems Linear Regression,SVR,Decision Tree Regression,Random Forest Regression and ANN algorithms are used,in case of classification Logistic Regression,KNN,
SVC,Decision Tree Classifier,Random Forest Classifier and ANN algorithms are used and in the Clustering problem K-Mean and Hierarchial Clustering algorithms are used.
